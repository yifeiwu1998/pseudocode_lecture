# Introduction of myself
My name is Yifei Wu. 
I am from China. 
I am learning the pseudocode right now. 
I think that pseudocode is really hard for me. 
To reinforce my understanding, I decided to share my ideas and progress online.
I am going to update this website once a week. 
In the website, I am going to share with you not only basic knowledge of pseudocode, but also the real-world applications.
